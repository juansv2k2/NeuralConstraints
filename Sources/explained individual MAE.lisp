The error message suggests that there is a type issue in the `convert-to-double-float-vector` function, specifically with how the `map` function is used to convert the elements of the input vector to `double-float`.

We should ensure that `input` is a sequence before applying `map`, and we should also use the correct method to coerce the elements from integers to `double-float`.

Let's fix the `convert-to-double-float-vector` function:

```lisp
(defun convert-to-double-float-vector (input)
  "Convert a vector of integers to a vector of double-float values."
  (make-array (length input) :element-type 'double-float
              :initial-contents (map 'list (lambda (x) (coerce x 'double-float)) input)))

(defun fuzzy-equal (vec1 vec2 &key (tolerance 1e-5))
  "Compare two vectors of double-floats with a given tolerance."
  (and (= (length vec1) (length vec2))
       (loop for v1 across vec1
             for v2 across vec2
             always (<= (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))))

(defun get-prediction-and-mae (input nn)
  (let* ((normalized-input (normalize1 (convert-to-double-float-vector input)))
         (index (position normalized-input inputs :test #'fuzzy-equal)) ; Use fuzzy-equal for comparison
         (expected-target (and index (nth index targets))) ; Get the corresponding target
         (prediction (snn:predict nn normalized-input))
         (denormalized-prediction (denormalize2 prediction))
         (mae (and expected-target (snn:mean-absolute-error nn (list normalized-input) (list expected-target))))) ; Calculate the MAE
    (when mae
      (format t "MAE: ~a~%" mae))
    (list denormalized-prediction mae)))

(get-prediction-and-mae
 (apply #'vector
        '(0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1))
 nn)
```

Changes:
- The `convert-to-double-float-vector` function now correctly maps over the input sequence, converting each element to a `double-float` using `lambda` and `coerce`.

This should resolve the sequence type error and allow the function to correctly handle and normalize the input.
