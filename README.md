# NeuralConstraints

NeuralConstraints is a suite of computer-assisted composition tools that integrates a feedforward neural network as a rule within a constraint-based compositional framework. It combines the predictive generative abilities of neural networks trained on symbolic data with a rule-based compositional system supported by an advanced backtracking constraint algorithm. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for exploring symbolic neural generation, offering a higher level of compositional control compared to conventional neural generative processes.

## Features

- **Neural Network Integration**: Leverages feedforward neural networks trained on symbolic data for generative tasks in Max.
- **Constraint-Based Framework**: Provides a rule-based compositional system with advanced backtracking capabilities.
- **Symbolic Neural Generation**: Facilitates symbolic music generation with enhanced control.

## Dependencies

To use NeuralConstraints, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Max**: Version 8.6.5 or later
- **Moz'lib**: Updated version
- **Bach**: Updated version

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies listed above.
