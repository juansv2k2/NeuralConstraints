NeuralConstraints is a suite of computer-assisted composition tools that integrates a feedforward neural network as a rule within a constraint-based compositional framework. NeuralConstraints combines the predictive generative abilities of neural networks trained on symbolic data with a rule-based compositional system supported by an advanced and backtracking constraint algorithm. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for exploring symbolic neural generation, offering a higher level of compositional control compared to conventional neural generative processes facilitated by the constraint solver.
