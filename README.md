# NeuralConstraints

NeuralConstraints is a suite of computer-assisted composition tools that integrates a feedforward neural network as a rule within a constraint-based compositional framework. It combines the predictive generative abilities of neural networks trained on symbolic data with a rule-based compositional system supported by an advanced backtracking constraint algorithm. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for exploring symbolic neural generation, offering a higher level of compositional control compared to conventional neural generative processes.

⚠️ Note: This library is not yet publicly released and is currently undergoing a major restructuring of the source code. While most abstractions are functional, some remain limited in scope. To get started, open the Introduction-tutorial.maxpat file, then explore the 'Tests (Frontiers)' folder for a broader overview of the core features.

## Features

- **Neural Network Integration**: Leverages feedforward neural networks trained on symbolic data for generative tasks in Max.
